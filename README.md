# MQ6-Gas-Sensor-Analytical-Model 

The author would like to acknowledge the following research paper for modelling the MQ6 gas sensor in Python. 

Ajiboye, A. T., Opadiji, J. F., Yusuf, A. O., & Popoola, J. O. (2021). Analytical determination of load resistance value for
MQ-series gas sensors: MQ-6 as case study. Telkomnika, 19(2), 575-582.

This model will be helpful in understanding the MQ6 sensor characteristics, sensitivity analysis and calibration.
