# MQ6-Gas-Sensor-Analytical-Model-and-PPM-Calculation

The author would like to acknowledge the following research paper for modelling the MQ6 gas sensor in Python. 

Ajiboye, A. T., Opadiji, J. F., Yusuf, A. O., & Popoola, J. O. (2021). Analytical determination of load resistance value for
MQ-series gas sensors: MQ-6 as case study. Telkomnika, 19(2), 575-582.

This model will be helpful in understanding the MQ6 sensor characteristics, sensitivity analysis and calibration. The verification of the analytical model has been carried out for the Winson MQ6 Gas sensor. The datasheet can be downloaded from this resipository.
